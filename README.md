Restaurant Reservation and Point of Sale System (RRPSS) is a console-based application designed and developed for restaurant staff to manage restaurant reservations, orders, and invoice generation. The application covers key features such as updating the menu, staff records, orders, reservations, etc.  

This project covers the object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and key design considerations used to implement the application. The design will also be represented in a UML Class Diagram and UML Sequence Diagram for one of the features, showing the interaction and relationship between the objects. Moreover, several test cases are included as well to ensure that the application meets the requirements stated beforehand.
